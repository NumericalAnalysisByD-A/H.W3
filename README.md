# H.W3 - Gauss-Seidel & Jacobi methods
A matrix can be solved according to the Gauss-Seidel / Jacobi method, provided that a matrix with a dominant diagonal is obtained (a test is performed in the exercise).
The results to be displayed will not be complete because a stop condition e = 0.001 (as defined in the home exercise) was selected.
In order to get accurate results you can change the "e" in any of the methods
